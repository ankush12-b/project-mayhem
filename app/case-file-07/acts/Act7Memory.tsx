He documented the cognitive lapses in his journals: whole days appearing in wrong sequences, staff forgetting names they had worked with for years, and clocks running at offset cycles. The mainframe itself began experiencing similar temporal decay—its storage sectors degrading into biological clusters, overwriting operational system files with corrupted logs.</p>

Load the boot loader system file (`boot_loader.sys`), resolve block dependencies in sequential order (from corrupted_001 to corrupted_008), and monitor the real-time Memory Core Defragmenter grid on the right to guide the sector reconstruction.</p>
